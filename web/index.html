<h1>TemplAT</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
TemplAT is a general-purpose text-file <strong>template engine</strong>, designed to be used as an API from <strong>Java</strong> applications or servlets.
It is small (39K) and simple, yet surprisingly powerful.
It does not have any external library dependencies.

<h3>Simple</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
The TemplAT language is very simple to learn. It contains only the most basic programming constructs: <strong>if-then-else</strong>, <strong>loop</strong>, and <strong>include</strong> (with parameters). It also allows calling Java <strong>methods</strong> and accessing Java <strong>arrays</strong>. That's all there is to it. And yet, these few simple tools provide a powerful templating language.
</div>

<h3>Small</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
The TemplAT class library consists of a <strong>39K jar</strong> file. And that's it. It is designed to contain only what is necessary to provide its simple language, and <strong>nothing more</strong>. It is self-contained, and does not rely on any other external libraries.
</div>

<h3>Useful</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
TemplAT can be used for generating <strong>HTML</strong> pages by a Java servlet for a web server. It could just as easily be used for generating Java, C++, or SQL <strong>source code</strong>. It is useful for any text file where you need some kind of <strong>programming ability</strong> (loops, if-then-else, includes, method calls).
</div>

<h3>Reliable</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
The TemplAT source code's correctness is backed by a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests. This ensures that each new release will add features and improvements while preventing regression. It allows for the developers to refactor code and improve its internal state without introducing new bugs. The internal structure of the code is clean, simple, and straightforward.
